# The following measure assumes that the importance of a node does not depend only on its own (topological) properties,
# but also on the importance of the community in which it is community.
# E.g., a node in a community that is linked with many other community is more important than an equivalent node in an isolated community.
# This measure assumes that the community structure is given (e.g., computed by a community detection algorithm).
# The value of each node cannot computed with the Shapley value (that do not assume a community structure),
# but with a similar measure that uses the given community structure, called Owen value
# As for Shapley value, the Owen value can be computed for every characteristic function
# However, as for Shapley value, the naive implementation takes exponential time
# Here, we present a polynomial time algorithm for the Owen value when the characteristic function is value(C) = |N(C)| = \sum_{u \in N(C)} 1

# All above measures assume that all coalitions are feasible
# Next, we consider that the feasibility of coalition is constrained from the graph G
# Specifically, a coalition C is feasible only if for every pair of nodes u,v in C there is a path in G that: (i) consists only of nodes in C; (ii) connects u and v.
# E.g., in the graph G={(1,2),(2,3)}, the coalition {1,3} is not feasible, whereas the coalition {1,2,3} is feasible
# Clearly, the value of each node cannot computed with the Shapley value (that assume all coalitions are feasible),
# but with a similar measure, named Myerson value
# As for Shapley value, the Myerson value can be computed for every characteristic function
# Moreover the Myerson value can always be computed in polynomial time in the number of feasible coalition (and the size of the graph)
# The algorithm simply generate all possible feasible coalitions, through a DFS visit of the graph, and add the contribution of this coalition to the Myerson value of each node
# Be careful, that, in many setting, the number of coalitions allowed by the graph can be exponentially large
# (in particular, if G is a clique, all coalitions are feasible and we are just implementing the exponential-time naive algorithm for the Shapley value)
# In order to use the Myerson value as a centrality measure it makes sense to consider superadditive characteristic functions,
# that is characteristic functions that increase as new node are added to the coalition.
# In this way, a node is more important when it enables big coalitions.
# Below, we show an implementation when the characteristic function is value(C) = |C|^2
# For more information, see Skibski et al. (AAMAS 2014) sec. 5
