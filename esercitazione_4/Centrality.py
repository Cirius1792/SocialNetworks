#A parallel version of page rank can be achieved by dividing the graph in num_jobs different directed subgraphs. By assuming that num_jobs is a perfect square (4, 9, 16, 25, ...) this can be done dividing the set of nodes in sqrt(num_jobs) subsets, and having subgraph 0 containing only edges from the first subset to itself, subgraph 1 containing only edges from the first subset to the second subset, ..., subgraph sqrt(num_jobs) containing only edges from the second subset to the first subset, and so on. The update operation can be then executed in parallel for each subgraph. Results can be easily combined since the new page rank of a node i in the j-th subset is given by the rank coming from nodes in the first subset (contained in the j-th result) + the rank coming from nodes in the second subset (contained in the sqrt(num_jobs)+j-th result) + ... + (1-s)/n. This combine operation also can be parallelized with each job taking care of combining the ranks of a different subset of nodes.
